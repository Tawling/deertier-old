            There was some concern that the previous poll for <a href="http://deanyd.net/sm/index.php?title=14%25_Chargeless" target="_blank">Low% Chargeless</a>
            was too easy to mess with so we're redoing it with Straw Poll. If you voted on the previous poll you can go ahead and vote again.

                    Deer Tier has been migrated to a new host and the database has been restored from a backup taken on April 9, 2019. This is the most recent backup that I had, unfortunately.
					Records submitted between April 9 - 23 will need to be resubmitted. Any accounts created during this time will also need to be recreated.
                </p>
				<p>
					If you missed the outage, Deer Tier was down from April 23 to May 3 due to a "service interruption" on our old host (you can read about it <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/01/a2_hosting_down/" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested). The web server was restored after a few days
					but as of right now the database still hasn't been restored. I didn't want to keep Deer Tier offline any longer so I've given up and moved to a new host.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm very sorry about the lengthy outage and the lost data. I'll be setting up a better backup process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aside from the lost data I believe everything should be working. Please let me know if you notice any issues.
